Project for First Semester written in Python using Tkinter for GUI

The Problem:
The current tools we have for things like encryption/decryption/compression, etc. are either too complex or widespread across
the internet. We aim to change that with a simpler application with User Friendly Design and an all in one mentality.

The Solution:
A alternative to other complex tools for file operations, but with simpler UI and easy to use design.

Modules Used:
Crpytography
OS
shutil
Tkinter
Random
PIL
