# end-sem-hackathon-project
Project for End Sem Hackathon 2022 (BU)

The Problem:
The current tools we have for things like encryption/deletion/compression, etc. are either too complex or widespread across
the internet. We aim to change that with a simpler application with User Friendly Design and an all in one mentality.

The Solution:
A WinRAR alternative with simpler UI and easy to use design.

Modules Used:
Crpytography
OS
Random


Day 1(10/12/22):
Beggining development on the project and aim to have a working prototype by 5 p.m today.
Starting from scratch.
Update:
Realised that 5 p.m was an unacheivable goal so pushed it back to Sunday

Madhav Update#1 - 11:20 A.M:
Nearly done with the Encryption Function.
Madhav Update#2 - 1:28 P.M:
Done with Encryption and Decryption, point to work out:
1. Key File needs to get deleted after each run of decryption script
2. Encrypted file (New) is stored in directory where exe is run similar to decrypted file, need to add functionality to choose directory.
