# end-sem-hackathon-project
Project for End Sem Hackathon 2022 (BU)

The Problem:
The current tools we have for things like encryption/deletion/compression, etc. are either too complex or widespread across
the internet. We aim to change that with a simpler application with User Friendly Design and an all in one mentality.

The Solution:
A WinRAR alternative with simpler UI and easy to use design.

Modules Used:
Crpytography
OS
Random
shutil


Day 1(10/12/22):
Beggining development on the project and aim to have a working prototype by 5 p.m today.
Starting from scratch.
Update:
Realised that 5 p.m was an unacheivable goal so pushed it back to Sunday

Madhav Update#1 - 11:20 A.M:
Nearly done with the Encryption Function.
